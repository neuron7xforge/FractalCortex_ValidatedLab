# FractalCortex_ValidatedLab

## Description

FractalCortex_ValidatedLab is a structured repository of formally validated methods, algorithms, and modular systems developed under the Neuron7X cognitive architecture. All included components are mathematically grounded, reproducible, and suitable for integration into AI systems with cognitive, fractal, spectral, or bioinspired processing.

This repository is not experimental in nature ‚Äî it contains operational methods that are validated, verifiable, and engineered for direct implementation into autonomous decision-making systems and neuro-inspired agents.
